        <p>I am a coding junky. That's probably the best way to describe it.  When I get 
          excited about something, it starts to affect my sleep. I started young and I feel 
          incredibly fortunate to be able to make a living from it.</p>
        <p>I am currently churning out software for <a href="http://www.macadamian.com">Macadamian</a>, 
          but you can find out more about that <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sebastien-martin/b/521/869">here</a>.</p>
        <p>This site is mostly to publish some personal projects that I've worked on over 
          the years.  You'll find those below. I figured this was a better medium than my 
          <a href="https://github.com/sebmartin">github home page</a> which is littered with
          less interesting projects.  I am in the process of tidying some code that I haven't 
          yet pushed to GitHub so there should be more coming soon.</p>

        <h1>projects</h1>
        <p>Most of my current spare time that I can devote to personal projects goes towards 
          something that I'm working on with my brother. I am not yet in a position to post 
          that code here yet but I will post utilities and hacks that are helping me along the 
          way when I can. So look out for that.</p>
        <p>In second place is an idea I had for using node.js and d3 for building a web 
          interface around git for reporting and visualizing your repo.  I haven't actually 
          started this yet but it's at the back of my mind.</p>
