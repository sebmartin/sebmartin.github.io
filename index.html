        <h1><span class="firstpartofthe heading">ABOUT</span> <span class="restofthe heading">ME</span></h1>
        <p>I am a software developer currently living in <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/preview#!q=Ottawa%2C+ON&data=!4m10!1m9!4m8!1m3!1d369836!2d-75.8002569!3d45.2501566!3m2!1i1382!2i790!4f13.1">Ottawa, Canada</a>.
          I am passionate about software to the point
          that when I get excited about something, it starts to affect my sleep. My father taught me how to code when
          I was just a kid and I haven't stopped since.  Today I feel incredibly fortunate to be making a living 
          from something that doubles as my favourite hobby.</p>
        <p>I am currently keeping busy at <a href="http://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a> hacking at iOS apps and helping reinvent commerce. 
          You can find out more about me <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sebastien-martin/b/521/869">here</a>.</p>
        <p>You can peek at some of my code from my <a href="https://github.com/sebmartin">GitHub home page</a> where
          I occasionaly post bits of code that I find interesting.</p>

        <h1><span class="firstpartofthe heading">PERSONAL</span> <span class="restofthe heading">PROJECTS</span></h1>
        <p>Most of my current spare time that I can devote to personal projects goes towards 
          a bit of an ambitious project that I'm working on with my brother. I am not in a position to post 
          that code here yet but I will post utilities and hacks that are helping me along the 
          way when I can. So look out for that.</p>
        <p>In second place is an idea I had for using node.js and d3 for building a web 
          interface around git for reporting and visualizing your repo.  This idea is still in 
          incubation.</p>
        <p>Below are projects that I have code to show for.</p>

              <h3><a href="https://github.com/sebmartin/given"><span class="firstpartofthe heading">given</span><span class="restofthe heading">JS</span></a></h3>
              <p>Given is a validation library for KnockoutJS that allows you to define form
                validation rules using a fluent syntax.  It also keeps your validation clean of
                other cruft and easy to read and understand.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
              <h3><a href="https://github.com/sebmartin/ALPDataObjects"><span class="firstpartofthe heading">ALP</span><span class="restofthe heading">DataObject</span></a></h3>
              <p>Lightweight Models to painlessly define and serialize/deserialize objects using NSCoding.  
                This library solves a lot of the same problems that github's <a href="https://github.com/github/Mantle">Mantle</a> 
                project solves, except I wrote this before Mantle was made public.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
              <h3><a href="https://github.com/sebmartin/mm2in"><span class="firstpartofthe heading">mm</span><span class="restofthe heading">2in</span></a></h3>
              <p>A tiny little python script to convert metric measurements to imperial.  It takes a metric measurement
                in different denominations and breaks it down into miles, feet, inches... all the way down to 1/16th of an inch.
                This was useful for some DIY project plans that I found online.</p>

              <h3><a href="https://github.com/sebmartin/scenic-route"><span class="firstpartofthe heading">Scenic</span><span class="restofthe heading">Route</span></a></h3>
              <p>This was a submission for the <a href="http://www.apps4ottawa.ca">Apps4Ottawa</a> contest back in 2012.  It was an iOS 
                app for getting around Ottawa by easily modifying driving directions to avoid parts
                of Ottawa's highways that are notorious for making you late.  Simply drop pins on 
                parts of the highway and the onboard algorithm will reroute to avoid the stretch
                of road in between.  Scenic Route also had Yellow Pages&trade; integration for local lookups.</p>

              <h3><a href="https://github.com/sebmartin/albums"><span class="firstpartofthe heading">Albums</span></a></h3>
              <p>A python+Django based online photo album website.  The motivation behind this was to have my own website to share
                photos but still take advantage of Google's picasa web albums.  This allowed me to keep using 3rd party apps to post 
                photos from anywhere.  Included in this project is a Bash script to use with cron to periodically pull metadata from the 
                picasa service and cache it to a local database.  Photos were then linked directly from google's servers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
              <h3><a href="https://github.com/sebmartin/FlatWSDL"><span class="firstpartofthe heading">Flat</span><span class="restofthe heading">WSDL</span></a></h3>
              <p>A small python script that will fetch a WSDL from a URL and flatten it by importing all referenced 
                parts (external files) into a single WSDL file.  I wrote this after spending too much time trying to 
                consume a WCF based web service from iOS.</p>
